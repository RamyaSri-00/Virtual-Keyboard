# Virtual-Keyboard
OBJECTIVE:
The main intention of this project is to  virtual text using OpenCV library of python.
This project is about using openCV and mediapipe libraries to utilize the web camera for writing in real time.The main idea is:
detect hands using mediapipe.
detect index and thumb fingers' tip locations.
if only index is over one of the keys change the transparency of the key.
if both index and thumb fingers are over a key add the letter of the key to the written text.
Proposed System:
A virtual keyboard is a software component that allows the input of characters without the need for physical keys.
Virtual keyboard allows for faster typing than traditional keyboards which can save time during those busy working hours.
It also has the added benefit of preventing hackers from intercepting passwords or personal information through key logging software because it doesn't use physical keys at all.
Methodology:
We used OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries as it makes us easy to run like hand tracking, face detection, facial landmark detection, pose estimation, and also image processing etc..
Conclusion:
The virtual text application's fundamental goal is to deliver an AI-based tool that allows users to text anything on screen using hand movements.
This system also gives the user the option of selecting any text from the toolbar.
